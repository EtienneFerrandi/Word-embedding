# Word-embedding

We use word2vec algorithm (unsupervised machine learning), with two different methods,  Common Bag Of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram. The first model, CBOW, aims at predicting the target word, knowing the context. The second, Skip-Gram, aims at predicting the words of the context, knowing the target word.
